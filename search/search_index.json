How to define a dataset A dataset is defined with a yaml configuration, and the data files. Any dataset configuration must inlcude a type, name, task(?), files defined. Files need to be configured with type , data type, file path in path , and any columns with their details. Optional fields are: headers , version_num , that defines the versions, url , source and description that define the dataset. type: dataset name: abalone source: UCI url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone description: Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements files: file1: type: csv data: dataframe path: abalone.mixed.numeric.csv headers: true columns: sex: header: Sex type: nominal data: integer labels: - 0 - 1 - 2 ... file2: type: csv data: graph path: causal_info_adjmat.csv headers: true columns: sex: header: Sex type: nominal data: integer ... Model Description : Algorithms written in Python that take in a dataset and execute a particular model. Function : Produce outputs based on the tasks and models. How to define a model A model is defined with a yaml configuration, alongside a python script that the model is executed on. A model must have a type, name, task and its path defined. Optional fields are: version_num , that defines the versions, url , source and description that define the model. type: model name: VAR-LiNGAM source: GitHub url: https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/gcastle description: Discovery of non-gaussian linear causal models task: discovery.temporal path: varlingam.py version_num: 1 Metric Description : Python implementations of metric calculations. Function : Take in the outputs provided by the model and output a numerical value, based on its configuration. How to define a metric type: metric name: accuracy_static source: NA url: NA description: Accuracy metric for static causal graph. task: discovery.static path: accuracy_static.py Context Description : A configuration that encapsulates a selected set of multiple datasets, models, metrics and hyperparameters. Function : Defined by users, contexts represent experiments carried out on a selection of components. Contexts are defined on user level, and all of the dataset-model tuple combinations are created and executed on the system level. How to define a context A context is created with a yaml notation. Any context should have a type, name, task(?), and at least one dataset, model and metric defined. name: Context Abhinav 1 task: discovery.static description: July experiment set datasets: - id: 14 version: 1 - id: 15 version: 1 models: - id: 22 version: 1 - id: 17 version: 1 metrics: - id: 12 version: 1 - id: 12 version: 2 Task Description : Logical definition of Causal/Machine Learning tasks. Function : Handles configurations between dataset/model/metric components through python functions. How to define a task A task takes in two files: a .yaml file that defines the type, name, path and the class name of a task, and a .py file that defines the task and its execution. The yaml file should only include the type , name , path , and the class fields. type: task name: discovery.static path: discovery.static.py class_name: DiscoveryStatic The python file should include any input and output functions for any dataset -> model, model -> metric, dataset -> metric relations, and the helper functions to facilitate the task. discovery.static.py and discovery.temporal.py files under the /task folder provides examples on construction of these functions. Benchmark Description : Benchmark defines run results of a number of executed contexts. On top of the executed context structure, benchmark includes run-configuration specific information like the system configuration, GPU-CPU resource profiling.","title":"CausalBench 101"},{"location":"basics/#causalbench-101","text":"","title":"CausalBench 101"},{"location":"basics/#dataset","text":"Description : Data and configuration files that describe the data in the data files.","title":"Dataset"},{"location":"basics/#how-to-define-a-dataset","text":"A dataset is defined with a yaml configuration, and the data files.

Install CausalBench, Please follow the installation guide for installing CausalBench.

Publish function takes in the public boolean argument which is False by default. In case you wish to publish directly as public, set the argument as True . context1.publish(public=True) Run a benchmark With a set context, running a benchmark is done with execute() function. run: Run = context1.execute() This will execute the benchmark. You can also print the run using print(run) command. Upload results Uploading results works the same as uploading any component, by using the publish() function. run.publish(public=True) Example CausalBench Execution: This example will fetch a context, execute it, and upload the results. from causalbench.modules import Run from causalbench.modules.context import Context def main(): # Select and fetch the Context context1: Context = Context(module_id=1, version=1) # Run selected Context run: Run = context1.execute() # Print Run execution results print(run) # Publish the Run run.publish() if __name__ == '__main__': main()","title":"How to Run CausalBench"},{"location":"quickstart/#how-to-run-causalbench","text":"You can use the python notebook attached, or follow along this page to get CausalBench into action.","title":"How to Run CausalBench"},{"location":"quickstart/#install-causalbench","text":"Please follow the installation guide for installing CausalBench.
